<h3>Media and Accessibility: Broadcast and Digital Best Practices and Techniques for a Blind and Low Vision Audience<br />by Robert Pearson</h3>
<img src="{{ "/images/robert.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Robert Pearson" width="200" height="133" class="speaker-img">
<p>Is there a lack of understanding of the need for media that is accessible? Does it lead to a lack of proliferation of fully accessible content? The media landscape in Canada is evolving and rapidly changing. Techniques such as described video, captioning,
    signing as well as web accessibility compliance - a11y - are gaining prominence in their importance and availability. </p>
<p>Accessible Media Inc. (AMI) is ‎responding to this through a number of initiatives including industry adopted description best practices, a described video TV Guide, an accessible online media player - the AMI-player - and the launch of a third broadcast
    service AMI-télé. </p>
</p>Robert has worked in the accessibility industry since 1999. He is an industry advocate, community builder, trainer and developer with experience from the Canadian federal government and abroad. Robert spent many years as the manager of accessibility for
a major Canadian financial institution. He sat as a member of the AODA Information and Communications Standards Development Committee and is currently Chair of the CRTC Described Video Best Practices Committee.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Document Accessibility into Your Organization’s Workflow<br />by Adam Spencer</h3>
<p>From authoring, to remediation, testing and compliance, PDF accessibility is a vital part in your complete accessibility strategy, in either the Public or Private sector. It’s also one of the most cost effective ways of ensuring your content is accessible. There is no “easy button” in accessibility, which makes the development of a cost effective and robust strategy critical to the success of your organization.</p>
<p>Adam Spencer is the Head of Document Accessibility Services for Accessibil-IT Inc., a dedicated PDF accessibility specialist.  As an active member on a number of ISO Committees for PDF and PDF Accessibility, Adam was also an active contributor to the development of the new international standards to ensure the accessibility and usability of PDF and adaptive technologies.</p>
<p>One of the major focuses for Adam is ensuring that all content is completely usable and accessible for users of adaptive technologies, including the development of accessible advanced mathematics techniques within PDF.</p>
<p>Adam is also the Vice-Chair of the Canadian Advisory Committee on TC 171 and TC 171/SC2 for the Standards Council of Canada.</p>

<h3>Drupal 8: The Leading Example for An Accessible CMS <br />by Mike Gifford</h3>
<img src="{{ "/images/mike.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Mike Gifford" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;">
<p>Drupal 7 really has led the way in ensuring that WCAG 2.0 recommendations are respected for anonymous users, editors and administrators. This has been pushed further with Drupal 8, and although not yet launched, there is a lot to be excited about. </p>
<p>In a non-technical way the presentation will focus on what has been added in general terms which can be applied to any open-source CMS. Centralized API changes and system-wide-defaults can benefit everyone.</p>
<p>One of Mike Gifford’s goals, through his company OpenConcept Consulting, is to fix the accessibility problems at the source using the Drupal open-source content management system. By taking this approach over a million web sites are enabled to become more accessible. With the Web increasingly becoming one of the main points of contact with citizens and customers, the ability for organizations to easily meet the relevant accessibility standards has become a customer-service issue. Mike is a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer and has been spearheading improvements in the Drupal community since 2009.</p>

<h2>Proposed topics</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>10 quick tests to check your web page for accessibility</strong>: I will present 10 tests that can be performed quickly to measure the accessibility of a web page. If you are a developer, you can fix before posting live. If you are a project
        manager or a client, you can ensure the level of accessibility without advanced coding knowledge.</li>
</ul>
