		<h3>Media and Accessibility: Broadcast and Digital Best Practices and Techniques for a Blind and Low Vision Audience<br />by Robert Pearson</h3>
		<img src="images/robert.jpg" alt="Robert Pearson" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;">
		<p>Is there a lack of understanding of the need for media that is accessible? Does it lead to a lack of proliferation of fully accessible content? The media landscape in Canada is evolving and rapidly changing. Techniques such as described video, captioning, signing as well as web accessibility compliance - a11y - are gaining prominence in their importance and availability. </p>
<p>Accessible Media Inc. (AMI) is ‎responding to this through a number of initiatives including industry adopted description best practices, a described video TV Guide, an accessible online media player - the AMI-player - and the launch of a third broadcast service AMI-télé.  </p>
</p>Robert has worked in the accessibility industry since 1999. He is an industry advocate, community builder, trainer and developer with experience from the Canadian federal government and abroad. Robert spent many years as the manager of accessibility for a major Canadian financial institution. He sat as a member of the AODA Information and Communications Standards Development Committee and is currently Chair of the CRTC Described Video Best Practices Committee.</p>

        <h2>Proposed topics</h2>
        <ul>
		<li><strong>10 quick tests to check your web page for accessibility</strong>: I will present 10 tests that can be performed quickly to measure the accessibility of a web page. If you are a developer, you can fix before posting live. If you are a project manager or a client, you can ensure the level of accessibility without advanced coding knowledge.</li>
