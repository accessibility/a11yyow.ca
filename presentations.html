            <a id="content"></a>Call for Presentations</h1>
        <p>According to Wikipedia: "An unconference is a facilitated, participant-driven conference centered on a theme or purpose." For the 2014 Ottawa Accessibility Unconference, we are combining both pre­planned presentations with participant selected presentations.</p>

        <p>We will start the day with an open panel discussion. We are aiming to invite experts with experience from various government levels (federal, Ontario and Quebec) to share their experience on creating and implementing web accessibility standards.</p>

        <p>The organizers are also inviting 4 speakers in advance. On the day, participants will vote to choose the other 8 presentations. In total, each person at the event will attend 4 presentations of their choice and the mornnig panel.</p>

        <p>We are soliciting proposals for the unconference portion of the event. Proposals must be submitted by midnight, Wednesday December 3. You will need to be available to speak during any time slot between 10 and 5 pm.</p>

        <h2>Possible topics</h2>

        <p>Tell us about working with other individuals, departments, institutions or sectors to achieve objectives such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>developing accessible policies, practices, tools and resources</li>
            <li>launching global or community accessibility initiatives</li>
            <li>addressing accessibility in the workplace</li>
            <li>and tell us the results of your collaboration</li>
        </ul>

        <p>NB: Lecture style presentations would be best. We will provide projectors but tables for small group work are only available in some of the rooms.</p>
        <p>Typically, presentations which provide attendees with a framework to
            <strong>move from ideas to action</strong>are more popular.</p>

            <strong>you won't be confirmed as a speaker until 10 am on Saturday</strong>.</p>
        <p>Please bring your presentation on a USB, place it publically on the web for access or bring it on a laptop. (The site does have WIFI but a backup version on your laptop is always wise.)</p>

      <p>
        This presentation will cover everything to do with WordPress and Accessibility.
        I will start by sharing some of the new things WordPress has been doing in regards to making the platform and websites more accessible. From there, I will showcase a variety of WordPress Accessibility tools, plugins, and themes; as well as demonstrate some how some of them work. Then, I will share information on the WordPress A11Y Group, what they do, and how anyone can contribute to their efforts. Lastly, I will share information on local resources, events, and groups that anyone interested in WordPress or website accessibility can get involved with.

      <h3>Media and Accessibility: Broadcast and Digital Best Practices and Techniques for a Blind and Low Vision Audience<br>by Robert Pearson</h3>
      <img src="images/robert.jpg" alt="Robert Pearson" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;">
      <p>
        Is there a lack of understanding of the need for media that is accessible?
        Does it lead to a lack of proliferation of fully accessible content?
        The media landscape in Canada is evolving and rapidly changing.
        Techniques such as described video, captioning, signing as well as web accessibility compliance - a11y - are gaining prominence in their importance and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessible Media Inc. (AMI) is ‎responding to this through a number of initiatives including industry adopted description best practices, a described video TV Guide, an accessible online media player - the AMI-player - and the launch of a third broadcast service AMI-télé.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert has worked in the accessibility industry since 1999. He is an industry advocate, community builder, trainer and developer with experience from the Canadian federal government and abroad.
        Robert spent many years as the manager of accessibility for a major Canadian financial institution.
        He sat as a member of the AODA Information and Communications Standards Development Committee and is currently Chair of the CRTC Described Video Best Practices Committee.
