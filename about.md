## Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) Background

The idea of a Global Accessibility Awareness Day started with a single [blog post](http://mysqltalk.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/challenge-accessibility-know-how-needs-to-go-mainstream-with-developers-now/) 
written by a Los Angeles-based web developer, [Joe Devon](http://www.globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/joe_devon.html)
[Jennison Asuncion](http://www.jennison.ca), an accessibility professional from Toronto discovered Joeâ€™s blog post purely by accident thanks to Twitter. After reading it, he immediately contacted Joe and they joined forces, leveraging their extensive and respective networks to realize the event.
