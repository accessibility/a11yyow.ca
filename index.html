<h2>Global Accessibility Awareness Day Background</h2>
<p>The idea of a Global Accessibility Awareness Day started with a single <a href="http://mysqltalk.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/challenge-accessibility-know-how-needs-to-go-mainstream-with-developers-now/">blog post</a> written by a Los Angeles-based web developer, <a rel="author" href="joe_devon.html">Joe Devon</a>. <a rel="author" href="http://www.jennison.ca">Jennison Asuncion</a>, an accessibility professional from Toronto discovered Joe’s blog post purely by accident thanks to Twitter. After reading it, he immediately contacted Joe and they joined forces, leveraging their extensive and respective networks to realize the event.</p>
