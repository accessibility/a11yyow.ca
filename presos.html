<h2>Open remarks discussion about collaboration to improve accessibility (with Sinead Tuite, Mike Gifford and David Berman)</h2>

<h3>Mike Gifford</h3>
<p>Drupal 7 really has led the way in ensuring that WCAG 2.0 recommendations are respected for anonymous users, editors and administrators. This has been pushed further with Drupal 8, and although not yet launched, there is a lot to be excited
                about. </p>
            <p>One of Mike Gifford’s goals, through his company OpenConcept Consulting, is to fix the accessibility problems at the source using the Drupal open-source content management system. By taking this approach over a million web sites are enabled to become more accessible. With the Web increasingly becoming one of the main points of contact with citizens and customers, the ability for organizations to easily meet the relevant accessibility standards has become a customer-service issue. Mike is a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer and has been spearheading improvements in the Drupal community since 2009.</p>
<h3>David Berman</h3>
<p>David Berman has 30 years of experience in design and communications and has worked extensively in the adaptation of printed materials for electronic distribution, including accessible Web and PDF design and software interface development.</p>
                              <p>As an author (Do Good Design [Peachpit/Pearson, 2009]), expert speaker, designer, communications strategist, and consultant, his professional work has brought him to over 50 countries.</p>
                              <p>In 2012, David was appointed as chair of the Carleton Access Network, a new committee on accessible information technology by Carleton University's READ Research, Education, Accessibility and Design Initiative.</p>
<p>In 2009, David was appointed a high-level advisor to the United Nations on how accessible Web design thinking can help fulfill the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

            <img src="{{ " /images/adam.jpg " | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Adam Spencer" class="speaker-img">
            <p>From authoring, to remediation, testing and compliance, PDF accessibility is a vital part in your complete accessibility strategy, in either the Public or Private sector. It’s also one of the most cost effective ways of ensuring your content
                is accessible. There is no “easy button” in accessibility, which makes the development of a cost effective and robust strategy critical to the success of your organization.</p>

            <p>Is there a lack of understanding of the need for media that is accessible? Does it lead to a lack of proliferation of fully accessible content? The media landscape in Canada is evolving and rapidly changing. Techniques such as described video,
                captioning, signing as well as web accessibility compliance - a11y - are gaining prominence in their importance and availability. </p>
            <p>Accessible Media Inc. (AMI) is ‎responding to this through a number of initiatives including industry adopted description best practices, a described video TV Guide, an accessible online media player - the AMI-player - and the launch of a
                third broadcast service AMI-télé. </p>
            <p>Robert has worked in the accessibility industry since 1999. He is an industry advocate, community builder, trainer and developer with experience from the Canadian federal government and abroad. Robert spent many years as the manager of accessibility
