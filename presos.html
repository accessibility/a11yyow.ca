            <p>How will the new legislative impact you?</p>
            <p>Recipient of the Diamond Jubilee Medal, The Correction Service Canada Award of Distinction and the Michelle C. Comeau Human Resources Leadership Award, Max Brault has worked in employment equity for the past 20 years. He is also the author of the paper “Interdepartmental Forum of Persons with Disabilities: A Dialogue for Action.” With 20 years of progressive and senior experience in employment equity and accessibility across Correctional Services Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Infrastructure Canada, Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and the Public Service Commission, he was able to leverage a diverse set of skills plus a network of relationships with Deputy Ministers, Departmental Executives, federal employees, and other government departments. During this time, he has gathered numerous awards and recognition among the federal government for the work I completed. Most recently, his career has culminated in a three year-long Senior Advisor role working with the Deputy Minister Champion for Persons with Disabilities. Here, he was instrumental in building consensus among key Deputy Minister’s community and a wide-variety of internal stakeholders, which lead to the successful proposal of the Federal Employees with Disabilities Task Force. </p>

            <img src="../images/julianna.jpg" alt="Julianna Rowsell" class="speaker-img">
            <p>Inclusive UX design considers accessibility as part of the user experience process. User research with people with disabilities informs the design process and makes products and services better by keeping the focus on human centred design.</p>
             <p>I’m Julianna. I am a mama for 3, a photographer and an accessibility advocate by nature. I am the Head of Accessibility and Inclusive Services at the Canadian Digital Service. I help to create simple, easy to use accessible and inclusive services for Canadians by partnering with other government departments.

            <p>I believe strongly that building capacity within the Government of Canada starts with helping give voice to Canadians with diverse needs. Government services should be about people, for people, with people. </p>
